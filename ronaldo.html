		<h3>Mr.Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
		<p><b> Mr.Cristiano Ronaldo.</b> Cristiano Ronaldo, born on February 5, 1985, is a Portuguese professional footballer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Ronaldo grew up on the island of Madeira and began playing football at a young age, eventually joining local club Andorinha before moving to Nacional and then to Sporting CP's youth academy.
<br>At Sporting CP, Ronaldo quickly established himself as one of the most promising young players in Portugal, making his first-team debut in 2002 at the age of 17. His impressive performances soon caught the attention of scouts from some of Europe's top clubs, and in 2003 he signed with Manchester United.<br>
Ronaldo spent six seasons at Manchester United, where he won three Premier League titles, one UEFA Champions League, and numerous individual awards, including his first Ballon d'Or in 2008. In 2009, he signed with Real Madrid for a then-world record transfer fee of €94 million.<br>
At Real Madrid, Ronaldo became the club's all-time leading scorer and won four UEFA Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, and four Ballon d'Or awards. In 2018, he signed with Italian club Juventus for €100 million.<br>
In addition to his club success, Ronaldo has had a prolific international career with the Portuguese national team. He made his debut in 2003 and has since become Portugal's all-time leading scorer, helping them win the UEFA European Championship in 2016 and the UEFA Nations League in 2019.<br>
Off the field, Ronaldo is known for his philanthropy and business ventures, including his clothing line, fragrance line, and hotel chain. He is also an ambassador for various charities and has donated millions of euros to causes such as disaster relief, cancer research, and children's hospitals.<br>
Throughout his career, Ronaldo has earned numerous accolades and records, cementing his status as one of the greatest footballers of all time.
